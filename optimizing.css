1. Code Better
    Do the work right the first time
    Don't rely on optimization tools
    Crap in, crap out

    Use shallow selectors, instead of really long redundant selectors
    e.g. by using ids, classes

    Organize your code
    - Find out where a good place for a piece of code is, instead of just throwing stuff into your stylesheet
    - Tip: Put a table of content up in comments at the very top of your stylesheet if you have a
    really bigand heavy CSS stylesheet
    - Have a way that you in the future can re-visit your code or someone else can so that can
    - see what the heck you were doing

    Use shorthand where possible

    Treat your CSS3 like it's art (because it's what makes the web look good)

2. Validate your CSS
    Because the smallest error can cause the biggest headaches
    So, be smart and use free tools like www.cssportal.com/css-optimize/ to optimize
    (maybe by compressing) your code


3. Compress your CSS
    You want your CSS to be highly readable, easy to navigate with your comments,
    indentation, spacing, organisation, table of content, but live/production-ready sites like a 
    live client site or we-app don't need all that
    You can have a developer CSS file that is different from the one you use for the live site.
    codekitapp.com - all-in-one compression, output, developer tool - basically very useful
    for optimizing CSS
    You can even automate this step and use it to easily have two versions of your CSS

4. Preload CSS3 (in the browser)
    You can improve performance and loading time of styles on your website by adding the following code:
    <link rel="preload" href="app.css" as="style">
    Using the REL attribute to tell the browser to preload this file as a stle
    So, it would just check a little bit earliewr and load that style up so there's less wait time

5. Lighten up your framework
    Frameworks are notoriously heavy meaning that there a lot of files, functions, assets and code that you do not need in your website
    When you downnload the framework, either remove eveything except what you plan on using
    or just download specific files from the framework that you need, load it up on your website or aplication
    Maybe, that would make the resources quicker to load

6. Learn a preprocessor language e.g Sass or Less
    They save coding time
    Will give more flexibility when it comes to styling
    You can export highly optimized images and create production-ready sites and apps
    
Some great optimization resources:
    Shorthand properties - Mozilla
    CSS Optimize
    CodeKit
    Sass
